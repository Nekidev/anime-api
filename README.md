# The Anime API Project

![Loli count](https://count.getloli.com/get/@anime-api?theme=gelbooru)

The Anime API is a collection of wrappers for different types of free anime-related APIs.


## Why anime-api (and not others)?

There are several reasons why would you prefer using anime-api:
- **Intuitive**: anime-api is designed to be intuitive. Supports autocompletion everywhere.
- **Complete**: Every actively supported API has no feature left apart.
- **Simple**: Get all the anime information you want with a single line of code.
- **Legal**: I shouldn't need to say this, but all the APIs are legal. (no free streaming services/others)
- **Actively supported**: Get new releases (with new API wrappers) every now and then.


## Installation

Using Poetry:
```
poetry add anime-api
```

Using pip:
```
pip install anime-api
```
